Skylight decodes ADS-B from a cheap RTL-SDR radio and renders the planes physically
flying over you onto a ceiling-pointed projector. A jet you'd hear overhead glides
across your ceiling at the same moment - labeled with its airline, type, and where it's
headed. Pure-black background so the projector's rectangle disappears and only the
aircraft (and stars) are lit.

It also draws the **real sky** behind the planes - sun, moon, bright stars and
constellations, and live **satellites including the ISS** - all at their true positions
for your location and time. Tune everything from your phone.

> Reference build is centered on **San Francisco International (SFO)**, but it works
> anywhere - set your location in the control panel and import your airport's runways
> by ICAO/IATA code (worldwide, via OurAirports) and you're flying.

## Features

- **Real-time overhead aircraft** from a local RTL-SDR (sub-second), or from a free web
  API with zero code changes - handy for trying it with no radio.
- **Type-aware glyphs** in a luminous, swept-wing style: widebodies tower over regional
  jets, **helicopters spin their rotors**, turboprops and GA aircraft spin their props.
- **Smooth motion** - interpolates the ~1 Hz fixes to 60 fps by rendering slightly in
  the past and tweening between real positions (no teleporting).
- **Comet trails**, altitude-graded color, and range rings + compass for orientation.
- **The airport** (runways) drawn at its true position, so you watch departures and
  arrivals line up with the runway.
- **Window to elsewhere** - each routed flight shows its destination **city, local time
  there, and miles-to-go**, plus a faint great-circle arc toward where it's headed.
- **Live sky layer** - sun, moon (with phase), bright stars + constellation lines,
  **naked-eye planets**, and **satellites / ISS** computed from TLEs. Scrub time
  forward/back from your phone, or jump straight to the next ISS pass.
- **Phone control panel** - every setting (rotation, theme, palette, filters, sky
  toggles, …) is live-tunable over your LAN and persists across reboots.
- **Optional sky camera** - point a PTZ camera (VISCA-over-IP + RTSP) at the sky and
  Skylight **automatically films the planes it's projecting**: ADS-B-driven pointing
  with latency-compensated lead prediction, a hybrid vision system that locks the plane
  to center, and a confidence-gated zoom ladder that punches in as the lock holds.
  Includes a **TV dashboard** (`/tv.html`) with the live feed + radar inset, and a full
  **debug UI** (`/tracker.html`) with jog pad, target table, and a star-capture
  calibration wizard.
- **Vision that knows a plane from a cloud** - the camera tracker fuses three signals:
  a classical blob detector (distant specks) + a large-object detector (big overhead
  planes), **track-before-detect** that picks the target by how it *moves* through the
  world like ADS-B predicts (clouds are world-static and lose), and an **optional
  neural airplane detector** (YOLOX-Nano ONNX, downloaded at setup) for a semantic
  "is it an airplane?" confirmation. It also **continuously self-calibrates** the mount
  from every locked pass, so the aim re-squares itself over time.
- **Appliance-ready** - boots straight to a full-screen kiosk on a Raspberry Pi 5
  (dual-output: projector + TV dashboard).

## Hardware

| Part | Suggested | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Receiver | **RTL-SDR Blog V4 + dipole** | The included dipole is plenty - planes are nearly overhead. The **V3 and V5 work identically** (same RTL2832U); if you're buying now, the V4/V5 are the current models. |
| Compute | **Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB)** | Decode + render. Active cooling for 24/7. See [minimum specs](#minimum-specs) for lighter setups. |
| Projector | A 1080p projector pointed up | Laser (e.g. Optoma GT2100HDR) gives the deepest blacks, but it's overkill - see the budget tip below. |
| Display link | micro-HDMI → HDMI | The Pi 5 uses **micro**-HDMI (not mini). |
| Mount | Rotating 1/4-20 stand, pointed up | Lower the stand for a bigger image; tape **+ a safety tether**. |
| Sky camera *(optional)* | Any **VISCA-over-IP PTZ** with RTSP (e.g. a 4K NDI conference PTZ) | For the auto-filming tracker. **Clamp the base rigidly** - fast slews will walk an unclamped mount and ruin the aim calibration. |

> **💡 Budget tip - you don't need an expensive projector.** The pricey laser short-throw
> is only worth it if you want the image visible in a **lit** room. If you're happy viewing
> it in a **dim/dark** room (the intended vibe), a cheap **native-1080p LED** projector like
> the **[Yaber Buffalo Pro U9](https://www.projectorcentral.com/Yaber-Pro_U9.htm) (~$150)**
> works great:
> - **No short-throw needed** - from the floor under an ~8 ft ceiling, even a 1.35:1 throw
>   gives a ~5.5 ft image.
> - **Low brightness is fine** (even better) - the content is sparse-on-black, so 200–400
>   lumens in a dark room actually looks *deeper*.
> - Just verify it's **native 1920×1080** (not "1080p supported"), has a **quiet fan**, and
>   an **HDMI input that shows on power-on**.

You don't need any of this to try it - see Quick start.

### Minimum specs

There are two workloads, and they have very different requirements:

- **Display + decode (the core ceiling piece).** This is light. The server is a small
  Node process; the rendering is a 2D canvas. A **Pi 4 (2 GB)** runs it comfortably, and a
  **Pi 3B / Pi Zero 2 W** will work for the display if you keep the canvas modest - cap
  `maxFps` (e.g. 30), trim `trailSeconds`, and lean on `DATA_SOURCE=api` so the Pi isn't
  also running `dump1090`. 1 GB is workable but tight; 2 GB+ is the comfortable floor.
- **The optional sky-camera tracker (vision + neural detector).** This is the heavy part
  and is what the **Pi 5 (8 GB)** recommendation is for - real-time RTSP decode plus ONNX
  inference. Don't expect the vision tracker to keep up on a Pi 4 or smaller.

Rule of thumb: **Pi Zero 2 W / 3B** = display only, **Pi 4** = display + local radio,
**Pi 5** = everything including the camera tracker.

## Quick start (local, no radio)

Runs entirely on your computer against a free public ADS-B API.

```bash
pnpm install
DATA_SOURCE=api pnpm dev
```

- **Display:** http://localhost:5173/
- **Control panel:** http://localhost:5173/control.html (or from your phone: `http://<your-ip>:5173/control.html`)
- **Camera tracker debug UI:** http://localhost:5173/tracker.html - runs against a
  built-in **camera simulator**, so the whole pointing pipeline (target selection,
  prediction, zoom, calibration) works with zero hardware.
- **TV dashboard:** http://localhost:5173/tv.html

**Then set your location** from the control panel's **Location** section - search a
city/airport, tap **Current** to use the browser's location, or type `lat,lon`
directly. The default is SFO, so until you change it you'll see San Francisco traffic
(or nothing, if your radius is small). Your airport's runways can be drawn too:
type its ICAO/IATA code into **Location → Runways** and they're imported automatically.

### With a radio (locally)

```bash
scripts/install-rtlsdr-fedora.sh    # rtl-sdr-blog driver + blacklist DVB-T (Fedora; see script for Debian)
scripts/run-dump1090-local.sh       # decode + serve aircraft.json on :8080
DATA_SOURCE=radio pnpm dev
```

## Raspberry Pi appliance

Full walkthrough in [`pi-setup/README.md`](pi-setup/README.md): flash + headless
provision the SD card, install the driver + decoder + app, and set up the boot-to-kiosk
display. Once it's running, push updates from your dev machine with:

```bash
PI_HOST=skylight.local ./scripts/deploy-to-pi.sh
```

### Optional: the neural airplane detector

The camera tracker works out of the box with its classical + motion-tracking vision.
For an extra semantic "is it an airplane?" signal (kills cloud locks, nails big
overhead planes), download the optional ONNX model **on the machine with the camera**:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-vision-model.sh        # YOLOX-Nano, Apache-2.0, ~3.5 MB (not committed)
sudo systemctl restart skylight-tracker
# verify: the tracker state shows vision.net.ready == true
```

It's fully optional - if the model (or `onnxruntime-node`) is absent, the tracker runs
classical-only with no errors. On a Pi 5 it adds ~0.8 to load average during a pass;
turn it off with `tracker.vision.net.enabled = false` or run it less often with
`tracker.vision.net.everyNTicks` if the Pi runs hot.

## Docker (server-driven projector)

If you'd rather drive a projector from a server (no Pi, no cabling to the projector),
run the server + display in a container:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
# display:  http://<host>:3000/      ·  phone panel: http://<host>:3000/control
```

Out of the box it uses the free **airplanes.live** API, so it runs with **no radio**.
To use your own ADS-B receiver, set `DATA_SOURCE=radio` and point `AIRCRAFT_JSON_URL`
at an existing dump1090 / readsb / PiAware feed on your network (or just change the URL
live from the control panel's **Source** section):

```yaml
# compose.yaml
environment:
  DATA_SOURCE: radio
  AIRCRAFT_JSON_URL: http://192.168.1.50:8080/data/aircraft.json
```

Config and the route/TLE caches persist in the `skylight-data` volume. The image is the
**server + display only** - the optional sky-camera tracker (which wants direct camera +
GPU access) is not containerized. If you reach the server over a custom hostname or a
tunnel rather than a LAN IP / `*.local`, add it to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (see below).

> **Reaching a decoder in another container:** the fetch happens **from inside the
> Skylight container**, so `localhost` won't work and a sibling container's name only
> resolves if both containers share a Docker network. Either use the decoder host's
> LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:8080/data/aircraft.json`), or attach Skylight to
> the decoder's network (see the commented `networks:` block in `compose.yaml`).
> The status line in `/control` shows *why* a fetch fails (DNS, refused, timeout).

## Troubleshooting

**No planes, using the public API.** The view is centered on SFO until you set your
location - open `/control` and use the **Location** section (search, **Current**, or
`lat,lon`). Then check the status line at the top of `/control`: it shows the live
source, count, and the exact failure reason if polling is failing. If you're far from
an airport, also widen the **Radius** slider.

**`source fetch failed: …` in the status line.** The reason in parentheses tells you
what's wrong, measured *from the server*:
- `DNS lookup failed (host)` - the server can't resolve that hostname. In Docker this
  usually means the decoder container isn't on the same Docker network (see the Docker
  section above).
- `connection refused` / `host unreachable` / `timeout` - the host resolved but nothing
  answered on that port; check the URL's port and that the decoder's web server is up
  (`curl http://<host>:8080/data/aircraft.json` from the machine running Skylight).
- `HTTP 429` - the public API is rate-limiting; Skylight now backs off automatically
  and recovers on its own. Planes hold position on screen through brief outages.

**Pointing at an existing dump1090 / readsb / PiAware feed.** Set the **Radio URL** in
`/control` → Source to your feed's `aircraft.json` (dump1090-fa serves it at
`http://<host>:8080/data/aircraft.json`) and switch the source to *radio*. No rebuild
needed - it applies on the next poll.

**Installer fails with `Unsupported architecture: armhf`.** You're on 32-bit
Raspberry Pi OS; Node.js no longer ships 32-bit ARM builds. Re-flash with
**Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** - every supported Pi (3/4/5, Zero 2 W) can run it.

**Runways for my airport.** `/control` → Location → **Runways**: enter the ICAO or
IATA code (e.g. `EGLL`, `EDDF`, `SNA`). Geometry comes from the public-domain
OurAirports dataset; very small airfields sometimes lack surveyed runway endpoints,
in which case you'll get a clear error.

**Clock on the TV dashboard is wrong.** It shows the Pi's system time - fix the
timezone with `sudo timedatectl set-timezone <Region/City>`.

## Configuration

`Config` ([`shared/src/config.ts`](shared/src/config.ts)) is the single source of truth,
persisted to `server/data/config.json` and live-editable from the control panel. Key
fields:

| | |
|---|---|
| `centerLat` / `centerLon` | **Your location** - where you're looking up. Editable from the panel's **Location** section (type a city, airport code, or `lat,lon`). |
| `locationName` | Display name for the current location, shown in the control panel. |
| `locationProfiles` | Saved places (favorite airports). Switch between them from the panel's **Location** section - tap **Save current** to store the active spot, then a chip to jump back to it. |
| `radiusMiles` | How far out to show (default 3 - "what you could realistically see"). |
| `rotationDeg` / `mirrorX` | Calibration for the looking-up flip (tune against a real pass). |
| `theme` | `ambient` · `telemetry` · `focus`. |
| `showStars` / `showSun` / `showMoon` / `showSatellites` / `showPlanets` | Sky layer toggles. Planets (Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Mercury) are drawn at their true positions, sized by brightness and labelled - so the display stays alive even with no traffic. |
| `skyTimeOffsetMin` | Scrub the sky clock for testing (0 = live). |
| `showDestArc` / `showRouteDetail` | "Window to elsewhere". |
| `tracker.*` | The whole camera subsystem - driver (`sim`/`visca`), camera IP, mount calibration, target selection criteria, prediction/pursuit tuning, zoom + vision behavior. All live-tunable from the tracker debug UI. |

**Using it somewhere other than SFO:** set your location from the control panel's
**Location** section (or edit `centerLat`/`centerLon`). Stars, sun, moon, and satellites
are computed for your coordinates automatically. The runway overlay is still SFO-specific
geometry - turn off **Airport runways** if you've moved, or replace it in
[`web/src/display/airports.ts`](web/src/display/airports.ts) with your local airport
(coordinates from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/data/)).

### Server environment

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DATA_SOURCE` | `radio` | `radio` (dump1090) or `api` (airplanes.live) |
| `AIRCRAFT_JSON_URL` | `http://localhost:8080/aircraft.json` | dump1090 feed |
| `SUPPLEMENT_API` | `1` | When on radio, merge the API too (keeps landing aircraft alive) |
| `PORT` / `HOST` | `3000` / `0.0.0.0` | HTTP + WebSocket |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | *(empty)* | Extra Host/Origin allowlist entries, comma-separated. Wildcards: `*.example.com`. Loopback, RFC1918 LAN, IPv6 ULA / link-local, and `*.local` are allowed by default. |
| `ALLOW_PRIVATE_LAN` | `1` | Set `0` to lock the server to loopback + mDNS only (no LAN phone control) |
| `GEOCODE_USER_AGENT` | *(skylight default)* | User-Agent sent to Nominatim for location search |

### Exposing Skylight on a custom hostname

Skylight binds `0.0.0.0` so the phone control panel works on your home Wi-Fi.
To stop browsers on other origins from talking to the server (e.g. a tab on
`evil.com` opening a WebSocket to your Pi over DNS rebinding), every request
is rejected unless its `Host` header (and a WebSocket's `Origin` header)
matches the allowlist.

The defaults cover the documented topology - `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`,
`[::1]`, `*.local`, and private LAN ranges (`10/8`, `192.168/16`,
`172.16/12`, IPv6 ULA + link-local). If you publish Skylight on a public
hostname or a tunnel, add it:

```bash
ALLOWED_HOSTS=skylight.mydomain.com,*.trycloudflare.com pnpm dev
```

- **`shared/`** - TypeScript types, config schema, and pure geo/projection/pointing math
  (ECEF az/el, mount model + calibration solver, alpha-beta trackers, FOV/zoom).
- **`server/`** - polls the radio (primary) and API (supplement), enriches aircraft,
  proxies TLEs, persists config, and pushes everything over a WebSocket.
- **`web/`** - Vite + React, four pages: the **display** (`<canvas>` renderer + celestial
  engine), the mobile **control panel**, the **TV dashboard**, and the **tracker debug UI**.
- **`tracker/`** - the camera brain: picks a target, predicts where it will be when the
  command actually bites (fix age + decode latency + motor latency), drives the PTZ with
  closed-loop velocity pursuit (sigma-delta speed dithering, soft limit guards,
  dead-reckoned pose), verifies the plane on-frame with a vision detector, and zooms in
  only while the lock holds. Runs against a **simulator** with zero hardware; replays
  recorded sessions deterministically for debugging.

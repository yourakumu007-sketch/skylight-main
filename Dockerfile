# Skylight server + display, for a projector driven by a server (issue #11).
#
# This image runs the Node server (which also serves the built web UI). It does
# NOT include the optional sky-camera tracker (sharp / onnxruntime) - that path
# wants direct camera + GPU access and is out of scope for a container.
#
# No radio in the container: point it at an existing dump1090/readsb feed with
# AIRCRAFT_JSON_URL (now runtime-tunable from the control panel too), or run with
# DATA_SOURCE=api to use the free airplanes.live feed with no hardware at all.
